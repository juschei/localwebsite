<h1 class="title">Rational Parametrization of the unit circle</h1>
</header>
<p><br/> The goal is to find rational functions <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\((f(t),g(t))\)</span> gives a parametrization of the unit circle. The well-known parametrization uses trigonometric functions and we will see below that this implies that what we seek <strong>does not exist</strong>. However, if we remove one point from the unit circle, it will be possible.</p>
<h2 id="calculating-a-rational-parametrization">Calculating a rational parametrization</h2>
<p>To continously parametrize a circle, we run around its perimiter (change of direction is allowed, but we can wlog assume that we are going counter-clockwise, otherwise we can just construct new fuctions from the old ones). Looking at the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>- and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-coordinates depending on time, we see that if we only consider the time on an interval of finite length we get functions that look <em>like</em> <span class="math inline">\(\sin\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\cos\)</span>. This is bad news, as those functions cannot be represented by rational functions, see below.</p>
<p>The plan is the following: start at <span class="math inline">\((-1,0)\)</span> from there we go counterclockwise until we get back to <span class="math inline">\((-1,0)\)</span>. If we however never really are at <span class="math inline">\((-1,0)\)</span>, just infinitely close to it:</p>

</figure>
<p>Expressing this in a parametrization <span class="math inline">\((f(t),g(t))\)</span>, the behaviour looks like this over time:</p>
<p>[x-coordinate](pdf/graph1.png " <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-coordinate over time) <br/> <img src="graph2.png%20$y$-coordinate%20over%20time" alt="y-coordinate" /></p>
<p>To get the coordinates at each point <span class="math inline">\((x,y)\neq (-1,0)\)</span> we can draw a line <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> between it and <span class="math inline">\((-1,0)\)</span>. The intersection withe <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis will have coordinates <span class="math inline">\((0,t)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is the slope of the line. Setting this equalto to the slope of the line segment between <span class="math inline">\((-1,0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((x,y)\)</span> we get <span class="math display">\[t = \frac{y}{x+1} \implies y = t(x+1).\]</span> For a fixed <span class="math inline">\(t\in \mathbb{R}\)</span> fulfilling the above equation is equivaent to <span class="math inline">\((x,y)\)</span> lying on the line <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>. Thus lying on the circle (i.e. making the equation <span class="math inline">\(x^2+y^2=1\)</span> true). Combining, we get that a point lies on the intersection of <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> and the circle if and only if <span class="math display">\[x^2 + t^2(x+1)^2 = 1.\]</span> Solving for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> yields <span class="math display">\[x=\frac{-2t^2 \pm \sqrt{4t^4-t(1+t^2)(t^2-1)}}{2(1+t^2)} = \frac{\pm 1 - t^2}{t^2+1}.\]</span> So, one solution is given by <span class="math inline">\((x,y)=(-1,0)\)</span> and the other one is <span class="math inline">\(\left(\frac{1-t^2}{t^2+1}, \frac{2t}{t^2+1}\right)\)</span>. These are the functions in <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> that we can use to parametrize the unit circle. If <span class="math inline">\((x,y)\)</span> lies on the circle, draw correspoding line <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> and for the slope <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> the point we just calculated will be <span class="math inline">\((x,y)\)</span>. It is straightforward to check the other direction, namely that every point of this form lies on the unit circle.</p>
<h1 id="why-cant-we-do-better">Why can’t we do better</h1>
<p>At the beginning we mentioned two impossibility claims: 1. The entire unit circle cannot be parametrized by rational functions. 2. <span class="math inline">\(\sin\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\cos\)</span> cannot be written as rational functions.</p>
<p>In order to prove this, we need a lemma from complex analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> be a holomorphic function on a simply connected domain <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(f(z)\neq 0\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(x\in D\)</span>, we can write <span class="math inline">\(f(z) = ce^{g(z)}\)</span> for a constant <span class="math inline">\(c\in \mathbb{C}\)</span> and a function <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> that is holomorphic on <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. <br/> <strong>Proof.</strong> Since <span class="math inline">\(f(z)\)</span> never vanishes, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{f}{f&#39;}\)</span> is a well-defined holomorphic function on <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is simply connected this means that there exists an antiderivative <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. Intuitively, what happes is <span class="math display">\[g(z)= \int \frac{f&#39;(z)}{f(z)}\,dz = \int \frac{1}{u}du = \log(u) = \log(f(z)) + c\implies e^g = f(z).\]</span> This does not work without restricting the domain of the logarithm (if might not be defined on all of <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>). To make this into a formal argument we consider <span class="math inline">\(h(z)=\frac{f(z)}{e^{g(z)}}\)</span>. We get that <span class="math inline">\(h&#39;(z)=0\)</span>, so since <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is connected, <span class="math inline">\(h(z)=c\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(c\in \mathbb{C}\)</span>, which means <span class="math inline">\(f(z) = ce^{g(z)}\)</span>, as desired. <br/><br></p>
